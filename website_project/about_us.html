            <div  class="p_about">
                <p>Two friends, in the midst of their busy lives, found crocheting as a way to relax and relieve stress. At first, it was just an unpretentious pastime, a moment of tranquility to forget their worries and put their creativity into practice. Between laughter and conversation, they began to meet regularly to learn new stitches and test different combinations of colors and yarns. Each piece they created, even the simplest ones, brought a unique feeling of satisfaction. Little by little, crochet stopped being just a hobby and became a true passion, a refuge where they felt free to express their creativity and dedication.</p>

                <p>Over time, the pieces made with so much care began to attract the attention of those around them. Friends, family and even neighbors were enchanted by the details and care of each handmade work. Soon, the first orders began to come in: a set of placemats for a special dinner, a blanket for the baby who was on the way, personalized bags and accessories. The demand grew, and they realized that they could transform this enjoyable pastime into something bigger. It was then that they decided to take a step forward, officially creating a small crochet workshop, where they could not only produce their pieces, but also share their love for handmade work with the community.</p>

            <div class="p_about">
                <p>Today, the workshop is a space full of inspiration, where each piece is made with patience and dedication. Each intertwined thread carries a story, each stitch reflects the care and tradition of craftsmanship. In addition to custom orders, they began to teach other people who, like them in the beginning, sought a moment of lightness and connection through crochet. The dream that began unpretentiously grew and became a life project, proving that, with love and dedication, any simple hobby can become something great and meaningful.</p>
